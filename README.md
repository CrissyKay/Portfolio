- Functional, deployed application
- GitHub repository with README describing the project
- Navbar must be consistent on each page.
- Navbar on each page must contain links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.
- All links must work.
- Must use semantic html.
- Each page must have valid and correct HTML. (use a validation service)
- Must contain your personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)
